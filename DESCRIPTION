Description: Error Distribution Rules are a combination between Distribution Rules and Error Dependence Plots.
    These are model agnostic and a drill-down technique to evaluate regression models, which consider
    multivariate interactions between features. EDRs uncover regions of the input space with deviating
    performance providing an interpretable description of these regions. They can be regarded as a
    complementary tool to the standard reporting of the expected average predictive performance. Moreover,
    by providing interpretable descriptions of these specific regions, EDRs allow end users to understand
    the dangers of using regression tools for some specific cases that fall on these regions, e.g., they
    improve the accountability of models. This package contains multiple methods to graphically visualize
    data frames composed of such rules.
